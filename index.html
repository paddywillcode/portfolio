            <h3>About Me</h3>
            
            <p>My name is Paddy and I am a student Software Engineer at Manchester Codes. I have worked with print/editorial design for almost a decade and am excited to start a new chapter applying this experience in a digital context.</p>
            
            <p>I discovered code during the pandemic in 2021. My friend works in tech and she recommended I try out some free courses online. I enjoyed it so much and saw an opportunity to move towards a different and hopefully more fulfilling career.</p>
